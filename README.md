<h2>📖 Project Story</h2>

<p>
Every organization, no matter how big or small, faces one recurring question — <b>“Where does the money go?”</b>  
That simple question became the spark behind my <b>Finance Distribution Analysis</b> project.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to understand how funds flowed across departments, categories, and time — not just through numbers, but through visuals that tell a story.  
So I turned raw Excel data into a <b>Power BI dashboard</b> that reveals spending behavior, allocation priorities, and financial imbalances — making every dataset a chapter in a story of smarter decision-making.

<h2>🎯 The Mission</h2>

<p>
The goal wasn’t just to analyze figures — it was to <b>visualize financial movement</b> in a way that brings clarity to complex data.  
This project set out to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>💵 Trace how budgets are distributed across multiple sectors.</li>
  <li>📈 Discover patterns in how and when money is spent.</li>
  <li>💡 Highlight insights that could shape future financial planning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📊 What I Built</h2>

<p>
Step by step, I built an <b>interactive Power BI dashboard</b> that feels like a map of financial activity.  
Each visual element — from category-wise bar charts to time-based trend lines — told a piece of the financial story.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>📈 <b>Trend Explorer:</b> Visualized how spending evolved across months and years.</li>
  <li>🏷️ <b>Category Tracker:</b> Compared funding across multiple financial domains.</li>
  <li>📉 <b>Insight Radar:</b> Exposed underfunded areas and overextended categories.</li>
  <li>📊 <b>Interactive Controls:</b> Empowered users to explore financial data hands-on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧠 My Learning Journey</h2>

<p>
Building this project taught me how <b>numbers can tell a story when presented the right way</b>.  
I learned to use <b>DAX functions</b> to calculate key performance metrics, mastered <b>Power Query</b> for cleaning messy data,  
and discovered how thoughtful dashboard design can make complex finance analytics both simple and intuitive.
